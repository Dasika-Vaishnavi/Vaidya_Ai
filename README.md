# Vaidya_Ai
This repository consists of the code that is built for the Unfold hackathon corresponding to the project Vaidya_Ai

## Project Name - Vaidya_Ai
**Project Description** - An ai based blockchain solution for healthcare systems
**Problem or Challenge**  - 
* Challenge 1 - To tackle the challenge of secure data storage in healthcare systems
* Challenge 2 - To bridge the gap between research and medical implications while protecting the identity of patient.
* Challenge 3 - To create an incentive mechanism to reward the patient for contributing and concenting to reserch with the patient's private data. 
## **Solution Implemented**
## "Vaidya_AI - A step towards making healthcare anonymous and accessible"
#### Vaidya_AI is implemented in 3 steps
#### Step-1: **Data collection and storage**
* To collect the data from the patient from a dashboard/app 
* To take concent and permission from the patient to store the records
* To hash the records and store them on IPFS
* To using Arcana Testnet and Arcana's Auth function, the data stored in the IPFS can be accesible as a DID.
#### Step-2: **Patient's dashboard and health trackers**
* The collected data can be directly accessed on the patient's dashboard
* AI systems are used for health and life style trackers
* This data can be used in training the AI and deep learning models.
* The dashboard gives the patient a health over-veiw and healthcare trackers checking for - prone diseases, checkup trackers, medical tarckers, diet trackers general life style trackers to predict possible aliments and suggest changes to improve quality of life.
* The dashbard contains an emergency SOS for instant healthcare support and universal health ID to access all your files with just scanning a QR code.
#### Step-3: **Incentivising patients and integrating reserch**
* Using the patient's DID Vaidya_AI can connect patient and reserch organization.
* The organizations can access preview about the data stats of a DID address and send a request to the patient with the corresponding DID.
* The patient can review the organization and can choose to proceed with the request or can negotiate or can decline the request.
* Once the patient accepts the request and the incentive is transferred, the reserch organization will be given access to the patient's data.
* The patient can also view where his data is being used and can access new-age results and direct access to the resercher if need in critical scenarios.

## Results or Impact
* Created Universal patient ID efficiient, anaonymous and secure data storage for patients.
* Improving overall life quality and incorporating preventive measures in healthcare systems.
* Financially aiding medical treatment cost through a structured, concented data transfer and incentive systems.
* Making latest studies and reserch accesible to benefactors. 

## Skills or Technologies Used
